This is sh33t, a script for generating boilerplate code like comment headers
and option parsing code. It is also useful for generating comment headers for
puppet files. It is easy to add support for new file types by adding an ERB
for it in the erb/ directory. You can also add custom variables by adding a
filetype.vars.rb file. Take a look at the existing files for examples.
